    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Gobi Manchurian is a popular Indo-Chinese dish where crispy, battered
      cauliflower florets are tossed in a sweet, tangy, and spicy sauce made
      with aromatics like ginger, garlic, and spring onions. It can be prepared
      as a "dry" version (as an appetizer) or a "gravy" version (to be served as
      a main dish with rice or noodles).
